# Introduction

An assignment by Shane Mkhize for Hyperolic.

The goal of the assignment is to use an existing input image that you can upload via a Flutter application, break it up into a bunch of tiles (segments), and replace every single tile in the image with an image from our image dataset (you can store it in the assets folder). You will be left with a new image that looks more or less like the original but made up of a large number of different smaller images.
